# Project Status: Universal Blog Template System

This document tracks the implementation status of all functions in the universal blog template system. The project has been completely refactored from a hardcoded stock market blog into a highly configurable, multi-niche blog template that can be customized for any industry or use case.

## Current Status

- Unified post preview UI with PostCard component.
- Homepage and related posts use consistent, accessible cards.
- Improved dark mode and social icon contrast.
- Outstanding: category/tag archive pages may need to be created or updated for full consistency.

## Latest Updates (June 8, 2025)

### Configuration System Improvements
- Fixed all syntax and type errors in `blog-template.ts` and `current-config.ts`
- Added proper `features` property with analytics configuration
- Changed navigation structure from `main` to `header` to match component expectations
- Made `legalPages` property required in BlogConfig interface
- Fixed corrupted AboutPageConfig and LegalPagesConfig interfaces

### UI/UX Enhancements (June 8, 2025)
- **Share Buttons:** Modernized design with gradients, rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects. Improved dark mode contrast with added borders. Fixed JSX lint error in copy button SVG.
- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Ensured `features.darkMode` flag in `current-config.ts` correctly controls visibility. Updated `FeaturesConfig` interface in `blog-template.ts` to include `darkMode` option.
- **Author Bio Social Icons:** Added borders for improved contrast in dark mode. Adjusted hover opacity for Twitter icon.
- **Homepage Content Curation:** Implemented manual selection of featured posts via a `featured: true` frontmatter flag. Added a new, separate "Latest Posts" grid to the homepage. These changes allow for better content highlighting and provide a clearer distinction between curated featured content and chronological latest posts.

### Legal Pages Implementation
- Added fully functional privacy policy, terms of service, and disclaimer pages
- Implemented centralized legal content management through configuration
- Added proper footer links to legal pages
- All legal content is now a generic template and should be customized by the user for their specific niche and legal requirements.

## Core Components

### Project Structure

**Implementation Status**: Completed

The basic structure of the Astro project has been implemented and completely refactored into a configurable template system. This includes:

- `tailwind.config.mjs` for styling configuration with dynamic theme support
- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
- Modular directory structure with configurable components and utilities
- Complete migration from hardcoded content to configuration-driven system

## Function Documentation Template

For consistency, all implemented functions should be documented using the following format:

```
### functionName(arg1: type, arg2: type, ...): returnType

**Description**: Brief description of what the function does.

**Arguments**:
- `arg1` (type): Description of the first argument
- `arg2` (type): Description of the second argument
...

**Returns**: Description of what the function returns

**Dependencies**: List of other functions or modules this function depends on

**Example Usage**:
```code
// Example code showing how to use the function
```

**Implementation Status**: [Completed/In Progress/Planned]
```
