/**
 * Current Active Blog Configuration
 * ---------------------------------
 * PURPOSE
 *   Holds *all* of the real, environment-specific values used by your blog (titles, URLs, counts, etc.).
 *   Anything in here is live data that will be bundled into your site.
 *
 * QUICK START
 *   • Change siteName below to rename your site – most derived values update automatically.
 *   • Update individual sections (branding, theme, layout, navigation…) as required.
 *   • Do *NOT* add types here – extend the interfaces in blog-template.ts instead.
 *
 * TIP
 *   If you rename or add keys, TypeScript will help you by flagging mismatches against the BlogConfig interface.
