 *   ‚Ä¢ Update individual sections (branding, theme, layout, navigation‚Ä¶) as required.
 *   ‚Ä¢ Do **NOT** add types here ‚Äì extend the interfaces in `blog-template.ts` instead.
 *
 * TIP
 *   If you rename or add keys, TypeScript will help you by flagging mismatches against the `BlogConfig` interface.
